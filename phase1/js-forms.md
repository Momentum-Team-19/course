## üéØ Objectives

- Complete selected spicy options for MyTunes
- Address special topics, including:
    - CSS Frameworks
    - Organizing code into functions
    - 

## üé¨ End of Phase Technical Presentations

The presentations at the end of this phase will be in the form of a short live presentation in front of teammates and invited guests. Each presentation should be **4-5 minutes long**, and no longer. 

**Your target audience is a brand new Momentum student who is just at the beginning of Phase 1 after Foundations.** Imagine you are teaching them how to do what you've done in this project. Give them the benefit of your experience over these past several weeks.

**This presentation does not have to be polished, scripted, or edited.** But your viewer should be able to follow what you're saying and understand the points you are making. You should illustrate the concepts you are talking about with examples from your code.

**Suggestions for how to use your time.**
~ 1 min - show the project in the browser and highlight its functions
~ 3 min - pick a couple of elements of the code that you want to explain line by line and show what you learned in the process
~ 1 min - a challenge you encountered in the project and how you got through it

## ‚úÖ Requirements for passing the phase

1. The code you chose to illustrate runs without errors.
2. The code you illustrate meets the (non-spicy) requirements of the project.
3. You can explain how your code works.
4. Your presentation includes JavaScript.
5. You make a presentation.
6. You ask at least one question in #code-help this week.

## üèóÔ∏è Project

- We will continue to work on the MyTunes project together during our team meetings.
- We will address select topics together as a group.
- Outside of class: revise your js projects, and select one to present in your video. Ask all the questions you have about how the code in your project works.
- You will have an OPTIONAL independent project to work on, [Ajax Notes]({{ site.data.phase1.projects.ajax_notes.url }}) project that reenforces similar concepts.
