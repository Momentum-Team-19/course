title: Completing Phase 4
phase: 4

Completing the course involves the following four priorities:

1. Successfully launch your working product.
2. Participate in a technical interview.
3. Submit peer feedback for your teammates.
4. Submit your project deliverables to Momentum staff.

{:.phase-success}
> - You have successfully launched a working software product.
> - You have made a substantive contribution to the project (a substantive contribution means that you have committed meaningful code in the project repo).
> - You have submitted all deliverables.
> - You have completed a technical interview with your instructor.

#### You might not complete the phase if

- You have not made a substantive contribution to the project.
- Your project is incomplete or does not meet MVP requirements in production by the launch date.
- You do not submit the deliverables.
- You cannot demonstrate working knowledge of the code and tools you've learned in the course during the technical interview.

If you don't complete the phase, you may be asked to do further project work before you can join Career Services.

## üì¶ Deliverables

These are the things you need to submit to Momentum staff to complete Phase 4.

You don't need to work on these things until next week. More detail will be shared with you then.

1. Information about the product you built ([form link](https://forms.gle/k8rkimEGyn7GMRJj6))
   1. The production URL
   2. A written description of your product
   3. A URL for your Github repo (with a README)
   4. Optionally: planning materials (Miro, Figma, wireframes, team charter, etc)
2. Information about yourself ([form link](https://forms.gle/j3xecXnHasUwcp6p9))
   1. A headshot (here are some examples)
   2. A short bio
3. Peer feedback, one form for each teammate ([form link](https://forms.gle/xCsbLEWzAPbgUBAd6)).

## üöÄ Product Launch

"Launch" means the public debut of a software product, when it is available for use by the general public.

**A successful launch means that your product MVP has been met and is running, without errors or major bugs, in production, and real users can go to your product's URL and use it.**

Your GitHub repo must be in a state that reflects professional best practices as much as possible.

- Absolutely **no commented out code** should be committed.
- **You should have a [project README][readmes]** that includes instructions for running the project locally and a link to your production URL.

Product launch is on {{ site.data.phase4.project.final_project.launch_date | date:"%A, %B %-d" }}, no later than {{site.data.phase4.project.final_project.launch_time }}.

## üíª Technical Interview

You will pair with an instructor one-on-one for 20-30 minutes to complete a small coding challenge. The goals of the interview include demonstrating proficiency with the code and tools you've learned in the course and practicing for technical interviews you'll have during your job search.

Interviews will take place on {{ site.data.phase4.project.technical_interviews.date | date:"%A, %B %-d" }}. Individual times are still TBD but likely to be in the morning.

The interview will consist of a small coding challenge like one of the following:

- Fix a bug in existing code.
- Write code to fix a failing test.
- Add a small feature (for example: a button that changes something in the UI; show some data on a page; add a new route/page) to existing code. This might involve adding a dependency or making a request to an API.

### Expectations & Rules

#### Talk it out & discuss

- Understand what you are being asked to do.
- You can (and should) ask clarifying questions.
- Talk through your approach before you start writing code.
- You can write pseudocode as you work if you aren't sure what syntax to write yet.
- You can ask for feedback on your code.

#### Resources you can and can't use

**You can look things up** in technical documentation, such as the React docs or MDN, during the interview. Being able to use technical documentation is an important skill for developers.

- **YES** to anything included in [devdocs](https://devdocs.io/) or package/library READMES (or other documentation).
- **YES** to linters and code formatters installed in your editor.
- **YES** to Googling a specific error message.
- **YES** to looking up code that you wrote for your own projects.
- **NO** to random how-to Googling (e.g. "how to reverse a string in Python", "build a calculator in Javascript")
- **NO** to ChatGPT or other AI tools. If you have AI tools in your editor, please turn them off for the interview.

### Interview outcome == üèÜ

In your interview we want to see you doing the following:

- Talk through your approach to the problem and the code you are writing.
- Understand what you are being asked to do and ask clarifying questions if you don't.
- Use developer tools in the browser effectively.
- Write and run code until you can get it doing what it should do.
- Look things up if you need to and show that you can apply material you look up in your code.
- Interpret and address errors or bugs that come up (they will come up!).

### Interview outcome == üí£

During this or any technical interview, doing the following things would lead to an unsuccessful outcome:

- Not doing what you are asked to do in the interview, incorrectly interpreting instructions, or making incorrect assumptions.
- Not asking questions or restating instructions to be sure you understand.
- Not talking through your approach to the problem and thought process.
- Not trying to write code and make changes until you can get it working.
- Not writing any code; not running your code.
- Giving up.
- Not using developer tools in the browser to get information and diagnose issues.
- Not reading and attempting to understand errors that come up.
- Ignoring, not noticing, or not acknowledging bugs that show up.
- Not looking things up if you need to; not applying what you look up.
- Making assumptions about what your code does without running it.

‚≠ê The goal is to demonstrate productivity and working knowledge, not perfection.

## üí¨ Peer Feedback

Every developer will submit feedback for each of their teammates using [these criteria for assessing team collaboration and communication skills](https://momentumlearn.notion.site/Peer-Feedback-Collaboration-Teamwork-ffb0b9daed12408b86b66122f6742b5e?pvs=4). A form to collect this feedback will be shared with you at the beginning of next week, to be submitted by {{ site.data.phase4.project.final_project.launch_date | date:"%A, %B %-d" }}.
