## ‚úÖ TODO today

We'll begin Python the way we began JavaScript, with some exercises and tests you can run to keep you on track. We're going to use an awesome free online tool called [Exercism](https://exercism.io/).

Please sign up using your GitHub account ([getting started instructions](https://exercism.io/getting-started)) and choose [the Python track](https://exercism.io/tracks/python). Make sure that you are in Practice Mode.

**If your exercises are locked** you need to switch from Learning Mode to Practice Mode. [Here's a short video showing you how to do that.](https://www.loom.com/share/ad7209af2267427889c98699f0694d11)

You can use the in-browser editor, or work through [their command line setup walkthrough](https://exercism.io/cli-walkthrough) to install Exercism on your computer.

‚ö†Ô∏è To run the tests locally, you will need a testing library called `pytest` installed. To install the necessary dependencies, run the following at the command line (it does not matter what directory you are in when you `pip` install something):

```sh
pip install pytest pytest-cache
```

In the Python track, complete the following exercises:

1. **Hello World**
2. **Two Fer**
3. **Raindrops**

And **at least 1** of the following, your choice:

- **Scrabble Score**
- **Hamming**
- **Resistor color**

Be sure to **read the instructions for each exercise carefully**. Here is [a guide to running the Python tests on Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/python/tests).

If you get through all four of these, please continue with other exercises that seem interesting or fun to you. There are lots to choose from, and you want as much practice with Python as you can get.

### ü•° How to submit your work

When you submit your solution for an exercism, you have the option to **publish** it. Please publish your solutions for the four exercisms required as specified above. You will then be able to see all your published solutions on your profile page.

You can find your profile page by clicking on your user avatar on Exercism and choosing "Public Profile" from the menu.

**To submit your work, paste the URL for your Exercism profile page into [this form](https://forms.gle/PH475ViBdgZfWbG48).**
