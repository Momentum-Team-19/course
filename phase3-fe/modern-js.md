## 🎯 Objectives

- Return to JavaScript!
- Review JS and learn JS syntax you'll need for React, like arrow functions
- Get familiar with the modern JavaScript ecosystem
- Try a short tutorial for React

## ✅ TODO

1. Review the code in [JavaScript You Need to Know for React]({{ site.team_notes_repo}}/blob/main/js-for-react.md). You'll need to be able to read and use the JS in these notes to work with React effectively. **It would be valuable practice to type out the examples and run them yourself.**

2. Complete **at least three exercises** from the list below on [Exercism.io JavaScript Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript). You're encouraged to work together.

3. Do today's project: the [Complete Beginner React Tutorial](https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react-2020/)

## 💫 PRO TIPS for Exercism

Exercises to choose from:

- Isogram
- Scrabble Score
- ETL
- Simple Cipher
- Hamming
- Gigasecond
- Grade School
- Raindrops

**If your exercises are locked** you need to switch from Learning Mode to Practice Mode. [Here's a short video showing you how to do that.](https://www.loom.com/share/ad7209af2267427889c98699f0694d11)

**Read the tests** provided with each exercise by clicking on the Tests tab in the editor (or opening the test file if you are using the CLI). The tests will show you _exactly_ how the function you're supposed to write will be called and with what arguments.

When you run the tests, only focus on ONE test at a time. Write code that will get that test -- and ONLY that test -- passing. Then, when you have one passing test, look at the next failing test. Again, just that one! Write code to pass this test. This may require you to _rewrite_ the code you just wrote to pass the first test. That's ok. Writing code like this is called Test-Driven Development (TDD) and it's a useful skill to practice. **One test at a time, try to keep previously tests passing, read the test results each time _carefully_, and _be patient_.**

If you can do more than three, great! More practice is better.

## 🏗️ Project: Meet React

After you've warmed up with some Exercism challenges, do this short tutorial to take a quick introductory tour of React.

[Ali Spittel's Beginner's Guide to React Tutorial](https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react-2020/) is a really friendly tutorial for total beginners that will introduce you to the basic concepts that we will be learning about in this phase.

Instructions in that tutorial are provided both in writing and in the video. Use whatever you prefer. In either case, you will code along with the instructions.

The link below takes you to an empty repo on GitHub that you can push your tutorial code to.
