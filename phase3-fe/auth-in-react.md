## 🎯 Objectives

- Plan for collaborative project
- Understanding what "logged in" means in code
- Implementing token authentication in a React application
- Using local storage with state to store an auth token
- Making POST requests with Axios

## 🏗️ Collaborative Project

Today we begin the project we'll work on for the rest of the phase. Read [today's post]({% link posts.md %}) for more details.

Meet with your teammates and plan the team project. You should have detailed wireframes, an idea of user flow (how your user interacts with your UI), and a plan for components done by tomorrow.

Start with: What does my user see when they first land on this page? What will they do? What happens next? Draw sketches of each "screen" the user sees, and diagram how the UI changes when something happens.

🚫 **No writing code yet**! Today is for planning only. We'll cover working together on GitHub tomorrow.
