Welcome to the first day of Momentum's Software Engineering Immersive. We're so excited for you to take this leap into a new career.

We'll spend today getting oriented to what learning at Momentum is like and how it's different from other learning environments you may have been in.

And, we'll jump right into using two important tools that you will use throughout your career as a developer.

## âœ… TODO today

1. Fill out your first [self-assessment](https://classroom.momentumlearn.com), which measures where your understanding is before you learn the concepts in the first phase. We are not expecting you to know any of the concepts in this assessment yet.
2. Read the [Momentum Community Standards]({% link about/community_standards.md %}) and [How We Work Remotely at Momentum]({% link about/remote_work.md %}) docs in their entirety. Please ask questions today if you want clarification about anything you read.
3. Make sure your computer is all set up and ready to go. Get help from an instructor if you are stuck or something isn't working right.
4. Read the [Really Friendly Command-Line Intro](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E4ALJrjclTYE4C6lwIV517-SOXiZ-Dqb).
5. Read the [Really Friendly Git Intro](https://drive.google.com/open?id=125rubyTQpBwmpi6I_UzUWfT1aXeHmy5n).
6. Complete the [Git-It tutorial]({{site.data.phase1.projects.git_it.url}}) and [submit this form when you are done](https://forms.gle/jvQjs85BJ19JS1cWA).
