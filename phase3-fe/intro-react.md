## 🎯 Objectives

- Exercism review
- Intro to React
    - How does React work?
    - What does React code look like?

## 🏗️ Project: Freeshelf

Today, you'll start on your first React app without a tutorial. This is **due on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_freeshelf.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}**.

[React Freeshelf]({{ site.team_github_org }}/react-freeshelf-){:#custom-repo-link}

This should be challenging.

🧰 Please be sure to install AND USE the [React Developer Tools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en).
