## 🎯 Objectives

- Review token authentication
- Review POST requests
- How to work with forms in React
- Building a log-in form

## 🏗️ Collaborative Project

Work with your team to get some initial components rendering. You can render components individually just to get them showing up on the page, without completing the conditions to show them or determining the interaction between them yet.

As you are planning out what components you need, you may find it helpful to [read this documentation about Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react).

### Goals by the next meeting

- Your app can make GET requests for questions and answers OR cards and friends.
- Show questions or cards on the page.
- Have at least a solid start on POST requests for creating questions or cards.
- Deploy to Netlify as soon as possible.

**PRO TIP** ⭐ Your code needs to run locally with no errors before you can deploy it.
