## ‚úÖ TODO for your project team today

### 1. Determine the project you are building.

We'll workshop this idea today together in our second round project pitch.

### 2. Create a prioritized list of features.

Use the [Product Roadmap slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CfBqu0XJ2nu0YwX3udJ9tulN3CxK8Tdz/view?usp=share_link) for guidance on defining your MVP and prioritizing features.

### 3. Define your users and write user stories for every MVP and nice-to-have feature.

The [Personas & User Stories slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QCvM1hgpDYYdIfQvsfvNxiUztUTWDSyh/view?usp=sharing) will help. This is a necessary step before we will be ready to start planning implementation.
