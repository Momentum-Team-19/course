## 🎯 Objectives

- Find & fix bugs in your project
- Deploy your application to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/with/react/)

## 🏗️ Project: React Trivia | React Color Palettes

If you haven't finished React Trivia, you should aim to finish that. It is due on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_trivia.due_date | date: "%B %e" }}.

If you have finished it, or finish it early, please do the React Color Palettes project. This project gives you a lot of room for creativity, practice, and experimentation. Depending on how you interpret the requirements, it can be a relatively simple application, or quite complex.

The [React Color Palettes project]({{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_color_palettes.url}}) is due on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_color_palettes.due_date | date: "%B %e" }}.

React Trivia and React Color Palettes, if you do that project, should meet at least the **minimum functional requirements** and must be **deployed to Netlify.** 🚀
