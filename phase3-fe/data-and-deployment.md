## 🎯 Objectives

- Finding & fixing bugs in your project
- Deploying to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/with/react/)

## 🏗️ Project: React Job Search

If you haven't finished React Trivia, you should aim to finish that. If you have finished it, or finish it early, please do the React Job Search project.

The [React Job Search project]({{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_job_search.url}}) is due on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_job_search.due_date | date: "%B %e" }}.

Your application should meet at least the **minimum functional requirements** and must be **deployed to Netlify.** 🚀
